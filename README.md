# Firewall
This project was developed for the fullfillment of course requirement of **Logic in CS** at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. 
It is a basic firewall engine (with corresponding database) that accepts or drops packets based on predefined language.

## Getting Started
1) Download the ```Database.pl``` and ```Engine.pl``` files. You can also download the readMe.txt file for detailed description of the engine and how to run it.
2) Open SWI Prolog and launch the engine by typing the following command:\n
   ```
   ?- printResult.
   ```
3) Enter the packet details in the format specified in the readMe.txt file attached with the code

## Prerequisites
SWI Prolog (You can download it from this link: https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

## Built With
The engine has been coded completely in Prolog language (a logic programming language)
